# Description of the available noise curves

### Cosmic Explorer / CE
* Official CE noise curves to be used for future studies [These correspond to V5 from Feb 13, 2022 at https://dcc.cosmicexplorer.org/CE-T2000017 (public: https://dcc.cosmicexplorer.org/CE-T2000017/public)]:
  * CE-40: Main CE noise curve for most operations, 40km detector design.
  * CE-40-lf: An option for tuning the 40km CE to be particularly sensitive at low frequencies for science cases that are interested in that regime. The idea is to be able to switch to this sensitivity after a few observing runs for X many observing runs (or alternating ones), if the community thinks it would be useful.
  * CE-20: Alternative 20km detector desgin for
    1. A secondary CE with short arm length would synergize well with a long one across all frequencies.
    1. Smaller design will be less costly and hence provides alternative, if funding is not available for the 40km design.
  * CE-20-pm: Same as CE-40-lf, but this time tuned for high frequencies/post-merger science.
